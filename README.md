#### frequently at the ut & au area, mostly with friends or sitting alone and observing whatever. i have low social battery, so approach with care - most times i am not up to conversation and just want to hang around ‎ ‎ ‎ ヾ(˶ᵔ ᗜ ᵔ˶)

if i don't know you, please don't cuddle and hide behind me - it gets very awkward very fast, and i'll just move away. friends/green names + friends-of-friends are fine, though. i don't care as long as i know of you.

do not copy, upload, or take heavy inspo off my skins - i'll perma-hide if i think you did. on the other hand, compliments are crowns are highly appreciated. ...yes...give me an ego boost....

irls / da's & tt havers, int sparingly?!! i don't like feeding into others delusions, as it does some harm to me as well as an UDD haver, anywho - fictkins and c'links int freely! ‎ ‎ ‎ ദ്ദി(=•ω•=)๋࣭ 

'm extremely weary of underlust skins, i do not care who you are & most times i'll hide you out of spite. call it a 'trigger' for me or whatever, but that shit is disgusting. no exceptions, soz </3
