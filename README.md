#### 'm always at the utdr + au area‎ ‎ ‎- ‎ either alone, or w/ friends.

if i don't know you, don't cuddle or hide behind me - it gets awkward, and i'll just move away. as long as i know *of* you, you're fine to sit to next me.

don't copy, upload or take heavy inspo off my skins. i'll just perma-hide you if i believe you did. on the otherhand, compliments & crowns r heavily appreciated.

i have udd, autism + suspected aspd. all of these affect the way i behave - i try to regulate myself, so excuse me if you witness any outbursts / depersonalization i've had. 

i rarely use tonetags & don't quite need them myself, so just tell me if you need them constantly and i'll try my best.

irls / da's & tt havers - i ask to int sparingly. i'll respect your boundaries & such 'cause 'm not an asshole, but just know i won't be feeding into your unhealthy delusions.

**underlust** / **mst** / **leviathantale** & the such skins ***do not interact***. keep your fetish shit away from me - i don't care how pissy you get over it.
